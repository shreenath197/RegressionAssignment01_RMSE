Q.1.The following questions are to enhance your understanding of basic concepts and definitions. You are expected to answer these questions on your own without referring to internet. [6 Marks]
a. State any four business applications of machine learning.                                       (0.5*4 = 2M)
b. Explain the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised earning with example.                                                                                                                                           (1 M)
c. Provide differences between regression, classification and clustering problems. Give an example where each of these models could be used.                                                    (1+1+1 M)
Q.2.Solve the following matrix using simultaneous equations in python                              (2M)
                    6x+2y−5z=13,3x+3y−2z=13,7x+5y−3z=26
Q.3.The following dataset of size n = 63 provides total payment (in thousands) for all the claims of Swedish Kronor for geographical zones in Sweden. The variables are y = total payment in thousands and x = number of claims.
Find the intercept, coefficient value and error term for this regression problem.
How would you convey these numbers in a business context?                                  (2+2 = 4M)
